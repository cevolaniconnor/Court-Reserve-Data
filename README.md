Then each time block  is then avergaed to get the average usage per day. This data is relevant exclusively to Pickleball court usage. 
A court is considered used if it has a reservation, which includes lessons, clinics, pickleball machine reservations, and general court reservations. 
A dedicated Python script processes the "allData" file to filter the data according to these criteria for the desired output. The file can be viewed below.
